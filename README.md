# helpUS

#### The project os based on this template : https://github.com/gurayyarar/AdminBSBMaterialDesign

Initialy started on purpose for my high school's tutorat, to help organization. The goal is to make room and session easier to organize;

Tutors needs to specify their schedule which afterward is used to let know student when they can take a tutoring session. On the other hand, the school administration needs to have a time on time watch. 

Main functionnality were : 

- Allow tutors to specifiy their schedule
- ALlow students to book a tutoring session (in respect of the schedule)
- Generate a daily schedule of rooms and tutors in charge of the rooms
- Create a real-time schedule for tutors
- Basic messaging system to fluidify conversation between users (instead of e-mail)
- Send rooms's schedule, tutors's schedule and book alert by e-mail. 
- Allow tutoring session to continue even trought the pandemic


At the moment, the project has been stopped because it has not convinced the student's office.
